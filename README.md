# Arduino-Egg-Incubator
This is a program for an Arduino Nano-based chicken egg incubator prototype.
Arduino controls the temperature through a Triac module and a DHT temperature sensor.
A stepper motor allows the periodic rotation of the eggs, which is necessary during the incubation process.
Through the user interface it is possible to interact with the system variables (temperature, incubation time) and view the status of the incubation.
Thanks to the eeprom it is also possible to have momentary shutdowns without losing the incubation status.
